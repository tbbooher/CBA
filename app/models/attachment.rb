# Attachment uses Paperclip to attach files to any model including {ContentItem}
# and embeds Attachments.
#
# For example:
#   Model {Page} (page.rb)
#     embeds_many :attachments
#     validates_associated :attachments
#     accepts_nested_attributes_for :attachments, :allow_destroy => true
#
# If the attachment's mime-type is 'image', the image will be preprocessed by imagick
# to several formats (:popup, :preview, :medium, :thumb, and :icon)
# 
# The maximum file size accepted can be configured in `application.yml` with
# :max_size_of_attachments_in_mb = 10
